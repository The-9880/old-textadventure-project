# old-textadventure-project
A little text adventure I played around with two years back. No changes made except to remove the many chatty/snarky comments taking up lines.

Do note that actual gameplay hasn't really been implemented - the game lets you add as many players as you want and then tests a few basic
functions. 90% of the progress made was done in spare time I had during Computer Science class at the time, so it isn't very extensive nor
is it planned out at all.

# Brief Description

The game was meant to be a multiplayer, text-based rpg with the familiar hero-classes of Mage, Ranger, Warrior, and Rogue. There is some
functionality available for progression by way of levelling/upgrading items, and some of the groundwork has been laid for more interactive
features such as looting and formations in battles. 

A rudimentary combat system works right now, but is quite mundane. The main reason the game didn't go beyond testing is because I switched
my focus to exams at the time before I could get around to implementing locations and something resembling a storyline.
